# Early Disease Detection using AI-ML

## Project Overview:
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to develop a system for the early detection of skin cancer. By analyzing digital images of skin lesions, the system aims to accurately classify them as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Early detection of skin cancer significantly improves treatment outcomes and increases the chances of successful recovery. This system seeks to assist dermatologists in making more accurate and timely diagnoses.

This overview highlights the core objective of the project: early skin cancer detection through AI/ML-powered image analysis. It emphasizes the importance of early detection for improved treatment outcomes.
